# Retail-Chatbot
 
I created an online retail chatbot using Amazon Lex to help with customers grievances.
I configured a basic "Welcome intent" in Amazon Lex to control how my chatbot responds to user inputs. I then compiled a list of sample utterances that trigger different intents, which means my chatbot can recognize different user phrases and respond. I edited FallbackIntent to handle unrecognized or poorly understood user inputs. I designed a MessageGroup of variations, which makes my chatbot sound more natural and conversational. I then tested my bot's setup in both text and voice formats. This comprehensive testing helps me confirm that my chatbot is ready for real-world interactions!
